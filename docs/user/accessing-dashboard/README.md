# Accessing Dashboard

Once Dashboard is installed on your cluster it can be accessed in a few different ways. Note that this document does not describe all possible ways of accessing cluster applications. In case of any error while trying to access Dashboard, please first read our [FAQ](../../common/faq.md) and check [closed issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). In most cases errors are caused by cluster configuration issues.

Choose version of Dashboard you are using to get information about how to access it:

* [1.7.x and above](1.7.x-and-above.md)
* [1.6.x and below](1.6.x-and-below.md)
